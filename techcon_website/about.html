            <h2>TechCon History: From Local Meetup to Global Stage</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began humbly in 2018 as a small, regional developer meetup focused on open-source contributions. Held in a university auditorium, the first event hosted just 300 participants.
            </p>
            <p>
                By 2020, we pivoted to a hybrid format and expanded our reach globally, attracting thousands of virtual attendees and securing our first major keynote speaker from Silicon Valley. Today, TechCon is recognized as a mandatory stop on the international tech conference circuit.
